She was left behind and sour. And she wrote to me, equally dour.  She said "In the days

We build a SST template using "r16slice.nii.gz" and a rotated version of itself (rotated by
15 degrees).  We then visually compare the template ("T_template0.nii.gz") and the two
images used to make the template ("r16slice.nii.gz" and "r16sliceRotate15.nii.gz").  We
also visually compare with a rotated version of "r16slice.nii.gz" by 7.5 degrees
("r16sliceRotate7.5.nii.gz").
